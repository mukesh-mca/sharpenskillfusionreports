- Remove the existing "JAX-WS" libraries from your project
- From the JDev menu, choose Tools - Manage Libraries
- From the left side, choose New
- In the new window enter a new library name "My JAX-WS Client"
- Click on Add entry, and select
	<your_jdev_home>\wlserver\server\lib\weblogic.jar
	<your_jdev_home>\oracle_common\modules\internal\features\jrf_wlsFmw_oracle.jrf.wls.classpath.jar
- Click on OK
- Click "New" again and enter a new library name "My JAX-WS Web Service"
- Click on Add entry, and select
	<your_jdev_home>\wlserver\server\lib\weblogic.jar
- Click on OK twice
- Open your project properties and in the "Libraries and Classpath" page, click on "Add Library" and select your newly created libraries
- When run, the java should now work.
 
If more than one library has problems, you will need to repeat the process.
We have detected the same problem in "Weblogic 12.1 Remote-Client". This library needs the same jar as used before:
	<your_jdev_home>\wlserver\server\lib\weblogic.jar
